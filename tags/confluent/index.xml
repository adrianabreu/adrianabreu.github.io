Sadly, it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my expectations. I thought it was a much more robust product that would fit our scenario. We were doing a similar filter in Spark, where we were paying traffic costs for both Confluent and AWS. So with kSQL at least we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for our AWS traffic.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Confluent Wire Format In Scala</title><link>https://adrianabreu.github.io/blog/2024-11-04-wire-format-scala/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 17:49:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.github.io/blog/2024-11-04-wire-format-scala/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Confluent for the last few months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly configuring the Terraform project and querying the API for some kSQL setup and tuning. When we had ready our sandbox environment, I wanted to test the throughput.
If you follow the docs is straightforward, you need to use the serializer from the Confluent library. In fact if you use Spark you can use some nice wrapper as ABRiS.</description></item></channel></rss>
