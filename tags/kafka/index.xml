Sadly, it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my expectations. I thought it was a much more robust product that would fit our scenario. We were doing a similar filter in Spark, where we were paying traffic costs for both Confluent and AWS. So with kSQL at least we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for our AWS traffic.</description></item></channel></rss>
