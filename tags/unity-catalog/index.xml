This last number included several on-call posts on Medium. I found these quite useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I got an alert from Metaplane that a cost monitor dashboard was out of date. I checked the processes, and everything was fine. I ran a query to check the freshness of the data and it was ok too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Metaplane checks our delta table freshness by querying the table information available in the Unity Catalog. For some unknown reason that metadata didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any update. I ran an optimization operation (the table tiny) and the metadata didn&amp;rsquo;t update either.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enabling Unity Catalog</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-05-23-enabling-unity-catalog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 07:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-05-23-enabling-unity-catalog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks setting up the unity catalog for my company. It&amp;rsquo;s been an extremely tiring process. And there are several concepts to bring here. My main point is to have a clear view of the requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disclaimer: as of today with &lt;a href="https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks">https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks&lt;/a> release 1.17.0, some steps should be done in an &amp;ldquo;awkward way&amp;rdquo; that is, the account API does not expose the catalog&amp;rsquo;s endpoint and should be done through a workspace.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
