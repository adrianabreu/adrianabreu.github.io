However, my Lenovo P1 Gen 3 laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t work well with Linux, leading to frequent issues with the camera and graphics (screen flickering, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, and it hurts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve triend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) but it was quite bad to be honest. But as I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of WSL2 and WSLg, I decided to give it another shot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Querying the databricks api</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-01-26-querying-the-databricks-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 09:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-01-26-querying-the-databricks-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring databricks SQL usage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my company, we adopted databricks SQL for most of our users. Some users have developed applications that use the JDBC connector, some users have built their dashboards, and some users write plain ad-hoc queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know what they queried, so we tried to use Unity Catalog&amp;rsquo;s insights, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for our case. We work with IOT and we are interested in what filters they apply within our tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tweaking Spark Kafka</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-27-tweaking-spark-kafka/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 12:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-27-tweaking-spark-kafka/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m facing a huge interesting case. I&amp;rsquo;m working at Wallbox where we need to deal with billions of rows every day. Now we need to use Spark for some Kafka filtering and publish the results into different topics according to some rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t dig deep into the logic except for performance-related stuff, let&amp;rsquo;s try to increase the processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading from Kafka you usually get 1 task per partition, so if you have 6 partitions and 48 cores you are not using 87.5 percent of your cluster. That could be adjusted with the following property &lt;code&gt;**minPartitions&lt;/code&gt;.**&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Duplicates with delta, how can it be?</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-03-20-delta-duplicates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:50:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-03-20-delta-duplicates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Long time without writing!
On highlights: I left my job at &lt;strong&gt;Schwarz It&lt;/strong&gt; in December last year, and now I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time employee at Wallbox! I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with my new job, and I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced interesting stuff. This one was just one of these strange cases where you start doubting the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my main tables represents sensor measures from our chargers with millisecond precision. The numbers are quite high, we are talking over 2 billion rows per day. So the analytic model doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle that level of granularity.
The analyst created a table that will make a window of 5 minutes, select some specific sensors and write there those values as a column. To keep the data consistent they were generating fake rows between sessions, so if a value was missing a synthetic value would be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Testing Databricks Photon</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-08-12-testing-photon-engine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 09:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-08-12-testing-photon-engine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was a bit skeptical about photon since I realized that it cost about double the amount of DBU, required specifically optimized machines and did not support UDFs (it was my main target).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Databricks Official Docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="limitations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Does not support Spark Structured Streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not support UDFs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not support RDD APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not expected to improve short-running queries (&amp;lt;2 seconds), for example, queries against small amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;

Most of the changes were as dramatic as moving tables from ORC to delta revamping the partition strategy to some as simple as upgrading the runtime version to 10.4 so the ETL starts using low-shuffle merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at my job, we have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of jobs. Each ETL can be easily launched at *30 with different parameters so I wanted to dig into the most effective strategy for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Associate Spark Developer Certification</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-07-21-passed-certification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 12:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-07-21-passed-certification/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took (and passed with more than 90% yay!) the &lt;a href="https://databricks.com/learn/certification/apache-spark-developer-associate"&gt;Associate Spark Developer Certificaton&lt;/a&gt;. And before I forget I want to share my experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, I needed to install Windows as there was no Linux support for the control software used during the exam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, you need to disable both the antivirus and the firewall before joining. I didn&amp;rsquo;t disable the antivirus and the technician contacted me as there was a problem with the webcam despite I was able to see myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a controlled window started by the software, not a browser page (I had a good zoom on the example docs they provide, and well not the same on the software window).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can mark the questions for reviewing them later.&lt;/li&gt;

And it can provide some useful insights, for example in my previous company we use it to detect where the people left at the initial app wizard. (We could measure it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple to export your data to BigQuery: &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/bigquery-export"&gt;https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/bigquery-export&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe your lake is in AWS or Azure. In the next lines, I will try to explain how to load the data in your lake and some improvements we have applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Qbeast</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-06-30-qbeast/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-06-30-qbeast/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I ran into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qbeast_io"&gt;Qbeast&lt;/a&gt; which is an open-source project on top of delta lake I needed to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introductory post explains it quite well: &lt;a href="https://qbeast.io/qbeast-format-enhanced-data-lakehouse/"&gt;https://qbeast.io/qbeast-format-enhanced-data-lakehouse/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is quite good and it seems helpful if you need to write your custom data source as everything is documented. And well as I&amp;rsquo;m in love with note-taking I want to dig into the following three topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining how the format works (including optimizations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describing how the sampling push is implementing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the table tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1-qbeast-format"&gt;1. Qbeast format&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be better explained with diagrams. Remember delta lake? We had a _delta_log folder with files pointing to files. Now Qbeast has extended this delta_log and has added some new properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spark Dates</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-29-spark-dates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 15:43:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-29-spark-dates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I can perfectly describe this as the scariest part of the exam. I&amp;rsquo;m used to working with dates but I&amp;rsquo;m especially used to suffering from the typical UTC / not UTC / summer time hours difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to make some simple exercises for this, the idea would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have some sales data and god knows how the business people love to refresh super fast their dashboards on Databricks SQL. So we decided to aggregate at different levels the same KPI, our sales per store. Considering some data as:&lt;/li&gt;

## The below code shown block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a DataFrame containing only the rows from DataFrame storesDF where the value in DataFrame storesDF's "sqft" column is less than or equal to 25,000. Assume DataFrame storesDF is the only defined language variable. Identify the error. Code block: `storesDF.filter(sqft &lt;= 25000)`

## The code block shown below contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new 4-partition DataFrame from the 8-partition DataFrame storesDF without inducing a shuffle. Identify the error. Code block: storesDF.repartition(4)

- [ ] The repartition operation will only work if the DataFrame has been cached to memory. 
- [ ] The repartition operation requires a column on which to partition rather than a number of partitions.
- [ ] The number of resulting partitions, 4, is not achievable for an 8-partition DataFrame.
- [X] The repartition operation induced a full shuffle. The coalesce operation should be used instead.
- [ ] The repartition operation cannot guarantee the number of result partitions.

```
Lines of code:
1. `storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
from_unixtime(col("openDate"), simpleDateFormat))`
2. `simpleDateFormat = "EEEE, MMM d, yyyy h:mm a"`
3. `storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
from_unixtime(col("openDate"), SimpleDateFormat()))`
4.`storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
date_format(col("openDate"), simpleDateFormat))`
5.`storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
date_format(col("openDate"), SimpleDateFormat()))`

- [ ] 6, 5
- [ ] 2, 4
- [ ] 6, 1

## Which of the following code blocks returns a DataFrame containing a column month, an integer representation of the month from column openDate from DataFrame storesDF? Note that column openDate is of type integer and represents a date in the UNIX epoch format — the number of seconds since midnight on January 1st, 1970. A sample of storesDF is displayed below:
![]("/images/databricks-cert/q50.png")

- [ ] `storesDF.withColumn("month", getMonth(col("openDate")))`
- [X] `storesDF.withColumn("openTimestamp", col("openDate").cast("Timestamp")).withColumn("month", month(col("openTimestamp")))`
- [ ] `storesDF.withColumn("openDateFormat", col("openDate").cast("Date")).withColumn("month", month(col("openDateFormat")))`

## Which of the following operations performs an inner join on two DataFrames?

- [ ] DataFrame.innerJoin()
- [X] DataFrame.join()
- [ ] Standalone join() function
- [ ] DataFrame.merge()
- [ ] DataFrame.crossJoin()

## Which of the following code blocks returns a new DataFrame that is the result of an outer join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId?

- [X] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "storeId", "outer")
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "storeId")
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "outer", col("storeId"))
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "outer", storesDF.storeId == employeesDF.storeId)
- [ ] storesDF.merge(employeesDF, "outer", col("storeId"))

## The below code block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new DataFrame that is the result of an inner join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId and column employeeId which are in both DataFrames. Identify the error.
Code block:
`storesDF.join(employeesDF, [col("storeId"), col("employeeId")])`

- [ ] The join() operation is a standalone function rather than a method of DataFrame — the join() operation should be called where its first two arguments are storesDF and employeesDF.
- [ ] There must be a third argument to join() because the default to the how parameter is not "inner".
- [ ] The col("storeId") and col("employeeId") arguments should not be separate elements of a list — they should be tested to see if they're equal to one another like col("storeId") == col("employeeId").
- [ ] There is no DataFrame.join() operation — DataFrame.merge() should be used instead.
- [X] The references to "storeId" and "employeeId" should not be inside the col() function — removing the col() function should result in a successful join.

## Which of the following Spark properties is used to configure the broadcasting of a DataFrame without the use of the broadcast() operation?

- [X] spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold
- [ ] spark.sql.broadcastTimeout
- [ ] spark.broadcast.blockSize
- [ ] spark.broadcast.compress
- [ ] spark.executor.memoryOverhead


## The code block shown below should return a new DataFrame that is the result of a cross join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF. Choose the response that correctly fills in the numbered blanks within the code block to complete this task. Code block:

- [ ] ```
 1. storesDF
 2. crossJoin
 3. employeesDF, "storeId"
```
- [ ] ```
 1. storesDF
 2. join
 3. employeesDF, "cross"
```
- [ ] ```

 2. crossJoin
 3. employeesDF
```

## Which of the following operations performs a position-wise union on two DataFrames?

- [ ] storesDF.write.path(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write(filePath)
- [X] storesDF.write.parquet(filePath)

## The code block shown below contains an error. The code block is intended to write DataFrame storesDF to file path filePath as parquet and partition by values in column division. Identify the error. Code block:

`storesDF.write.repartition("division").parquet(filePath)`

- [ ] The argument division to operation repartition() should be wrapped in the col() function to return a Column object.
- [ ] There is no parquet() operation for DataFrameWriter — the save() operation should be used instead.
- [X] There is no repartition() operation for DataFrameWriter — the partitionBy() operation should be used instead.
- [ ] DataFrame.write is an operation — it should be followed by parentheses to return a
DataFrameWriter.
- [ ] The mode() operation must be called to specify that this write should not overwrite
existing files.

## Which of the following code blocks reads a parquet at the file path filePath into a DataFrame?

- [ ] spark.read().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath, source = "parquet")
- [ ] spark.read.path(filePath, source = "parquet")
- [x] spark.read.parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath)


## Which of the following code blocks reads JSON at the file path filePath into a DataFrame with the specified schema schema?

- [ ] spark.read().schema(schema).format("json").load(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read.schema("schema").format("json").load(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read.schema("schema").format("json").load(filePath)
- [x] spark.read.schema(schema).format("json").load(filePath)

We may need to use an external library or so on. For that, we have the UDF, which accepts and return one or more columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have a function we need to register it on Spark so we can use it on our worker machines. If you are using Scala or Java, the udf can run inside the Java Virtual Machine so there&amp;rsquo;s a little extra penalty. But from Python, there is an extra penalty as Spark needs to start a Python process on the worker, serialize the data from JVM to Python, run the function and then serialize the result to the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spark DataSources</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-11-spark-data-sources/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 16:43:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-11-spark-data-sources/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As estated in the &lt;a href="https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-10-spark-structured-api"&gt;structured api section&lt;/a&gt;, Spark supports a lot of sources with a lot of options. There is no other goal for this post than to clarify how the most common ones work and how they will be converted to &lt;strong&gt;DataFrames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, all the supported sources are listed here: &lt;a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources.html"&gt;https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can focus on the typical ones: JSON, CSV and Parquet (as those are the typical format on open-source data).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spark Dataframes</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-10-spark-structured-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 17:02:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-10-spark-structured-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Spark was initially released for dealing with a particular type of data called &lt;strong&gt;RDD&lt;/strong&gt;. Nowadays we work with abstract structures on top of it, and the following tables summarize them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;thead&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;Dataframes&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Datasets of type Row (a generic spark type)&lt;/td&gt;

 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;SQL tables and views&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Same as Dataframes but in the scope of databases instead of programming languages&lt;/td&gt;

 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into the Dataframes.

But how does this work?
We can do two kinds of operations with Spark, transformations and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformations are operations on top of the data that modify the data but do not yield a result directly, that is because they all are lazily evaluated so, you can add new columns, filter rows, or perform some computations that won&amp;rsquo;t be executed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spark Architecture</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-07-spark-architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 17:02:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/spark-certification/2022-06-07-spark-architecture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Spark works on top of a cluster supervised by a cluster manager.

&lt;li&gt;Monitoring the health of all the nodes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we run a Spark application we generate processes inside the cluster where one node will act as a Driver and the rest will be Workers.

Let&amp;rsquo;s say we work for a bank and we are going to give cash to our clients if they get some people to join our bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have an advertising campaign definition like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;campaign_id&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;inviter_cash&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;receiver_cash&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;FakeBank001&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;FakeBank002&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;FakeBank003&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I participated in some small code problems and practised some regex. I got used to it and feel quite good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today I had to use it again. I had the following dataframe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;product&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;attributes&lt;/th&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;(SIZE-38, COLOR-BLUE)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O si realmente ha seguido el flujo de acciones que esperabamos (con un diagrama de sankey podríamos ver donde se han ido los usuarios).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Calcular el domingo de la semana</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-09-02-calcular-el-domingo-correspondiente/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:12:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-09-02-calcular-el-domingo-correspondiente/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A la hora de publicar reportes es común agrupar los datos por semanas. Otro motivo es alinearse con el negocio donde los cierres pueden producirse en días concretos, por ejemplo, un domingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En esos casos si tenemos los datos particionados por días nos interesa saber a que domingo correspondería cada uno de los datos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los que venimos de otros entornos tendemos a pensar en esas complicadas librerías de fechas (moment.js, jodatime, etc). Incluso alguien podría pensar en extraer los datos del dataframe y procesarlo en local.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Detectando ficheros pequenos Spark</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-08-25-detectando-ficheros-pequenos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-08-25-detectando-ficheros-pequenos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Uno de los mayores problemas de rendimiento que podemos encontrar en los datalake es tener que mover una enorme cantidad de ficheros pequeños, por el overhead que eso representa en las transacciones.

&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo mucha gente no sabe como detectar esto. Hace poco estuve jugando con un notebook y usando simplemente las herramientas del dbutils pude clasificar los ficheros que tenia en las entidades del datalake en múltiples categorías, así podría estimar cuantos ficheros había en un rango de tiempo.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spark windows functions (I)</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-08-11-spark-windows-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-08-11-spark-windows-functions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;En analítica, es muy común hacer uso de las funciones de ventana para distintos cálculos. Hace poco me encontré con un pequeño problema cuya solución mejoró muchísimo al usar las funciones de ventana, demos un poco de contexto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenemos una dimensión de usuarios donde los usuarios se van registrando con una fecha y tenemos una tabla de ventas donde tenemos las ventas globales para cada día&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y lo que queremos dar es una visión de cómo cada día evoluciona el programa, para ello se quiere que cada día estén tanto las ventas acumuladas como los registros acumulados.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conceptos básicos de Spark</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-11-09-spark-concepts-basicos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 19:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-11-09-spark-concepts-basicos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nota del autor&lt;/strong&gt;: Todos los contenidos de este artículo son extractos del libro &amp;ldquo;The Data Engineer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Apache Spark&amp;rdquo; que puedes descargar desde la pagina de databricks: &lt;a href="https://databricks.com/lp/ebook/data-engineer-spark-guide"&gt;https://databricks.com/lp/ebook/data-engineer-spark-guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un cluster no es más que un conjunto de máquinas trabajando de forma coordinada. Un cluster de Spark se compone de nodos. Uno actúa como DRIVER y es el punto de entrada para el código del usuario. Los otros actúan como EXECUTOR que seran los encargados de realizar las operaciones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Empezando en Spark con Docker</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-11-10-empezando-en-spark-con-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 19:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-11-10-empezando-en-spark-con-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A pesar de haber leído guías tan buenas como:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se me ha hecho cuesta arriba el poder conectar un notebook de jupyter y utilizar Scala. Entre configurar el apache toree para poder usar scala en los notebooks y algún error luego en spark al usarlo desde IntelliJ, me he acabado rindiendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nota del autor:&lt;/em&gt; Como disclaimer esto ocurre probablemente porque estoy en Manjaro y mi version de Scala es incompatible. Esta clase de problemas en su día las solucionaba fijando una versión, sin embargo, creo que teniendo una herramienta tan potente como es Docker estoy reinventando la rueda par un problema ya resuelto. Además de que voy a probarlo también en un windows para ver que es una solución agnóstical SO.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Correlated subqueries</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-09-26-correlated-subqueries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:43:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2019-09-26-correlated-subqueries/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Llevo un par de meses viendo como la mayoría de esfuerzos en el proyecto en el que estoy se centran en evitar los joins en las distintas capas de análisis.

&lt;p&gt;Tanto es así que llevo un par de días peleando con una pieza de código que me ha sorprendido. Partiendo de una tabla de hechos que agrupa datos para un periodo a hasta b, se quiere que se &amp;ldquo;colapsen&amp;rdquo; los datos de hace 14 días.
