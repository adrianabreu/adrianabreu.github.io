- [ ] `storesDF.withColumn(&#34;month&#34;, month(col(&#34;openDate&#34;)))`


## Which of the following operations performs an inner join on two DataFrames?

- [ ] DataFrame.innerJoin()
- [X] DataFrame.join()
- [ ] Standalone join() function
- [ ] DataFrame.merge()
- [ ] DataFrame.crossJoin()

## Which of the following code blocks returns a new DataFrame that is the result of an outer join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId?

- [X] storesDF.join(employeesDF, &#34;storeId&#34;, &#34;outer&#34;)
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, &#34;storeId&#34;)
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, &#34;outer&#34;, col(&#34;storeId&#34;))
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, &#34;outer&#34;, storesDF.storeId == employeesDF.storeId)
- [ ] storesDF.merge(employeesDF, &#34;outer&#34;, col(&#34;storeId&#34;))

## The below code block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new DataFrame that is the result of an inner join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId and column employeeId which are in both DataFrames. Identify the error.
Code block:
`storesDF.join(employeesDF, [col(&#34;storeId&#34;), col(&#34;employeeId&#34;)])`

- [ ] The join() operation is a standalone function rather than a method of DataFrame — the join() operation should be called where its first two arguments are storesDF and employeesDF.
- [ ] There must be a third argument to join() because the default to the how parameter is not &#34;inner&#34;.
- [ ] The col(&#34;storeId&#34;) and col(&#34;employeeId&#34;) arguments should not be separate elements of a list — they should be tested to see if they&#39;re equal to one another like col(&#34;storeId&#34;) == col(&#34;employeeId&#34;).
- [ ] There is no DataFrame.join() operation — DataFrame.merge() should be used instead.
- [X] The references to &#34;storeId&#34; and &#34;employeeId&#34; should not be inside the col() function — removing the col() function should result in a successful join.

## Which of the following Spark properties is used to configure the broadcasting of a DataFrame without the use of the broadcast() operation?

- [X] spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold
- [ ] spark.sql.broadcastTimeout
- [ ] spark.broadcast.blockSize
- [ ] spark.broadcast.compress
- [ ] spark.executor.memoryOverhead


## The code block shown below should return a new DataFrame that is the result of a cross join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF. Choose the response that correctly fills in the numbered blanks within the code block to complete this task. Code block:

__***1*__**.__**2__**(__3__)

- [ ] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. crossJoin
  3. employeesDF, &#34;storeId&#34;
```
- [ ] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. join
  3. employeesDF, &#34;cross&#34;
```
- [ ] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. crossJoin
  3. employeesDF, &#34;storeId&#34;
```
- [ ] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. join
  3. employeesDF, &#34;storeId&#34;, &#34;cross&#34;
```
- [X] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. crossJoin
  3. employeesDF
```

## Which of the following operations performs a position-wise union on two DataFrames?

- [ ] The standalone concat() function
- [ ] The standalone unionAll() function
- [ ] The standalone union() function

## Which of the following code blocks writes DataFrame storesDF to file path filePath as parquet?

- [ ] storesDF.write.option(&#34;parquet&#34;).path(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write.path(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write(filePath)
- [X] storesDF.write.parquet(filePath)

## The code block shown below contains an error. The code block is intended to write DataFrame storesDF to file path filePath as parquet and partition by values in column division. Identify the error. Code block:

`storesDF.write.repartition(&#34;division&#34;).parquet(filePath)`

- [ ] The argument division to operation repartition() should be wrapped in the col() function to return a Column object.
- [ ] There is no parquet() operation for DataFrameWriter — the save() operation should be used instead.
- [X] There is no repartition() operation for DataFrameWriter — the partitionBy() operation should be used instead.
- [ ] DataFrame.write is an operation — it should be followed by parentheses to return a
DataFrameWriter.
- [ ] The mode() operation must be called to specify that this write should not overwrite
existing files.

## Which of the following code blocks reads a parquet at the file path filePath into a DataFrame?

- [ ] spark.read().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath, source = &#34;parquet&#34;)
- [ ] spark.read.path(filePath, source = &#34;parquet&#34;)
- [x] spark.read.parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath)


## Which of the following code blocks reads JSON at the file path filePath into a DataFrame with the specified schema schema?

- [ ] The repartition operation will only work if the DataFrame has been cached to memory. 
- [ ] The repartition operation requires a column on which to partition rather than a number of partitions.
- [ ] The number of resulting partitions, 4, is not achievable for an 8-partition DataFrame.

3. `storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
from_unixtime(col("openDate"), SimpleDateFormat()))`
4.`storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
date_format(col("openDate"), simpleDateFormat))`
5.`storesDF.withColumn("openDateString",
date_format(col("openDate"), SimpleDateFormat()))`

## Which of the following code blocks returns a DataFrame containing a column month, an integer representation of the month from column openDate from DataFrame storesDF? Note that column openDate is of type integer and represents a date in the UNIX epoch format — the number of seconds since midnight on January 1st, 1970. A sample of storesDF is displayed below:
![]("/images/databricks-cert/q50.png")

- [ ] `storesDF.withColumn("month", getMonth(col("openDate")))`

## Which of the following operations performs an inner join on two DataFrames?

- [ ] DataFrame.innerJoin()
- [X] DataFrame.join()
- [ ] Standalone join() function
- [ ] DataFrame.merge()
- [ ] DataFrame.crossJoin()

## Which of the following code blocks returns a new DataFrame that is the result of an outer join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId?

- [X] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "storeId", "outer")
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "storeId")
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "outer", col("storeId"))
- [ ] storesDF.join(employeesDF, "outer", storesDF.storeId == employeesDF.storeId)
- [ ] storesDF.merge(employeesDF, "outer", col("storeId"))

## The below code block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new DataFrame that is the result of an inner join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on column storeId and column employeeId which are in both DataFrames. Identify the error.
Code block:
`storesDF.join(employeesDF, [col("storeId"), col("employeeId")])`

- [ ] The join() operation is a standalone function rather than a method of DataFrame — the join() operation should be called where its first two arguments are storesDF and employeesDF.
- [ ] There must be a third argument to join() because the default to the how parameter is not "inner".
- [ ] The col("storeId") and col("employeeId") arguments should not be separate elements of a list — they should be tested to see if they're equal to one another like col("storeId") == col("employeeId").
- [ ] There is no DataFrame.join() operation — DataFrame.merge() should be used instead.
- [X] The references to "storeId" and "employeeId" should not be inside the col() function — removing the col() function should result in a successful join.

```
- [ ] ```
  1. storesDF
  2. join
  3. employeesDF, "cross"

- [ ] storesDF.write().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] storesDF.write(filePath)
- [X] storesDF.write.parquet(filePath)

## The code block shown below contains an error. The code block is intended to write DataFrame storesDF to file path filePath as parquet and partition by values in column division. Identify the error. Code block:

`storesDF.write.repartition("division").parquet(filePath)`

- [ ] The argument division to operation repartition() should be wrapped in the col() function to return a Column object.
- [ ] There is no parquet() operation for DataFrameWriter — the save() operation should be used instead.
- [X] There is no repartition() operation for DataFrameWriter — the partitionBy() operation should be used instead.
- [ ] DataFrame.write is an operation — it should be followed by parentheses to return a
DataFrameWriter.
- [ ] The mode() operation must be called to specify that this write should not overwrite
existing files.

## Which of the following code blocks reads a parquet at the file path filePath into a DataFrame?

- [ ] spark.read().parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath, source = "parquet")
- [ ] spark.read.path(filePath, source = "parquet")
- [x] spark.read.parquet(filePath)
- [ ] spark.read().path(filePath)
