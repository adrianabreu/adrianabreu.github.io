      <div class="content">
        Yesterday I took (and passed with more than 90% yay!) the Associate Spark Developer Certificaton. And before I forget I want to share my experience:
In general:
First of all, I needed to install Windows as there was no Linux support for the control software used during the exam. Secondly, you need to disable both the antivirus and the firewall before joining. I didn&rsquo;t disable the antivirus and the technician contacted me as there was a problem with the webcam despite I was able to see myself. It is a controlled window started by the software, not a browser page (I had a good zoom on the example docs they provide, and well not the same on the software window). You can mark the questions for reviewing them later. About the exam:

      <div class="content">
        I can perfectly describe this as the scariest part of the exam. I&rsquo;m used to working with dates but I&rsquo;m especially used to suffering from the typical UTC / not UTC / summer time hours difference.
I will try to make some simple exercises for this, the idea would be:
We have some sales data and god knows how the business people love to refresh super fast their dashboards on Databricks SQL. So we decided to aggregate at different levels the same KPI, our sales per store. Considering some data as: data = [ (1656520076, 1001, 10), (1656520321, 1001, 8), (1656509025, 1002, 5), (1656510826, 1002, 3), (1656510056, 1001, 5), (1656514076, 1001, 8), ] ts = &#34;ts&#34; store_id = &#34;store_id&#34; amount = &#34;amount&#34; df = spark.createDataFrame(data, [ts, store_id, amount]) We need to parse that data into a readable date as the first number is an epoch or unix_time. Using the function from_unixttime this is quite simple:

        Sometimes we need to execute arbitrary Scala code on Spark. We may need to use an external library or so on. For that, we have the UDF, which accepts and return one or more columns.
When we have a function we need to register it on Spark so we can use it on our worker machines. If you are using Scala or Java, the udf can run inside the Java Virtual Machine so there&rsquo;s a little extra penalty. But from Python, there is an extra penalty as Spark needs to start a Python process on the worker, serialize the data from JVM to Python, run the function and then serialize the result to the JVM.

        As estated in the structured api section, Spark supports a lot of sources with a lot of options. There is no other goal for this post than to clarify how the most common ones work and how they will be converted to DataFrames.
First, all the supported sources are listed here: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources.html
And we can focus on the typical ones: JSON, CSV and Parquet (as those are the typical format on open-source data).

        Spark was initially released for dealing with a particular type of data called RDD. Nowadays we work with abstract structures on top of it, and the following tables summarize them.
Type Description Advantages Datasets Structured composed of a list of where you can specify your custom class (only Scala) Type-safe operations, support for operations that cannot be expressed otherwise. Dataframes Datasets of type Row (a generic spark type) Allow optimizations and are more flexible SQL tables and views Same as Dataframes but in the scope of databases instead of programming languages Let&rsquo;s dig into the Dataframes. They are a data abstraction for interacting with name columns, those names are defined in a schema.

      <div class="content">
        Spark provides an api and an engine, that engine is responsible for analyzing the code and performing several optimizations. But how does this work? We can do two kinds of operations with Spark, transformations and actions.
Transformations are operations on top of the data that modify the data but do not yield a result directly, that is because they all are lazily evaluated so, you can add new columns, filter rows, or perform some computations that won&rsquo;t be executed immediately.
