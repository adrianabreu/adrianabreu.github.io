Snowflake step curve from a data engineer perspective is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my boss asked me to test the Snowflake integrated MCP from Cursor. He’d been looking into Snowflake OAuth access, so I went to check the resources. Once again—as of January 27th, 2026—the Terraform resource for this still doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist (though the data source does, for some reason).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For connecting to snowflake you need to define a &lt;a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents-mcp#set-up-oauth-authentication"&gt;security integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Snowflake questionable choices</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2026-01-14-snowflake-questionable-choices/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:14:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2026-01-14-snowflake-questionable-choices/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I switched jobs all over again. I&amp;rsquo;m working in a data company called Shalion, where we provide insights about retail products online. If you&amp;rsquo;re brave enough to handle Snowflake&amp;rsquo;s quirks, &lt;a href="https://shalion.teamtailor.com/jobs/6328344-data-engineer"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re hiring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on revamping our permission grant system from &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost"&gt;permifrost&lt;/a&gt; to a terraform managed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also decided to embrace a 2 layer permission grant, using Access Roles (AR) and Functional Roles (FR). The former has access to the resources with the typical permissions (SELECT, USAGE, CREATE)&amp;hellip;, while the latter is the one that we assign to people and just groups access roles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Aprender de nuevo</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2026-02-13-learn-to-learn-again/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 20:14:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2026-02-13-learn-to-learn-again/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;2025 ha sido un año bastante loco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pasé la mayor parte del año sentando las bases de una startup en el mundo de la seguridad, haciendo frontend, backend, mucho devops y&amp;hellip; poco data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me pilló de lleno la era de la AI y como siempre, el campo ajeno es más verde. Viví la burbuja de v0 y mi trabajo respecto a este, fue bastante miserable. El proyecto a medida que crecía dejaba de ser funcional. Un cambio manual que arreglase el mismo era incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I’m Building Stuff – My New Motto</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2025-01-13-building-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:07:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2025-01-13-building-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past seven years, I worked in data, and I have mixed feelings about it. I still believe data is the most important part of any app, but it’s meaningless without the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m working at a startup, I’ve decided to focus on building things. To start, I revisited one of my older projects: a PDF parser about professor designations in the Canary Islands, where one of my best friends works as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Finding pet projects</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-08-13-finding-pet-projects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 07:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-08-13-finding-pet-projects/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As my company undergoes layoffs, I&amp;rsquo;m back on the job hunt. While I&amp;rsquo;m in the field of data, I often find myself missing the hands-on experience that comes from personal projects. I realized that I&amp;rsquo;m not practicing all the skills I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent interview, I was asked about my experience with sending reports via email—something I hadn’t done in a few years. That got me thinking: could I turn this into a pet project?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Developing on windows</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-03-22-developing-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 18:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-03-22-developing-on-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using MacOS at work and Ubuntu at home for my development tasks. However, my Lenovo P1 Gen 3 laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t work well with Linux, leading to frequent issues with the camera and graphics (screen flickering, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, and it hurts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve triend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) but it was quite bad to be honest. But as I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of WSL2 and WSLg, I decided to give it another shot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Querying the databricks api</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-01-26-querying-the-databricks-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 09:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2024-01-26-querying-the-databricks-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring databricks SQL usage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my company, we adopted databricks SQL for most of our users. Some users have developed applications that use the JDBC connector, some users have built their dashboards, and some users write plain ad-hoc queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know what they queried, so we tried to use Unity Catalog&amp;rsquo;s insights, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for our case. We work with IOT and we are interested in what filters they apply within our tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tweaking Spark Kafka</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-27-tweaking-spark-kafka/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 12:06:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-27-tweaking-spark-kafka/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m facing a huge interesting case. I&amp;rsquo;m working at Wallbox where we need to deal with billions of rows every day. Now we need to use Spark for some Kafka filtering and publish the results into different topics according to some rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t dig deep into the logic except for performance-related stuff, let&amp;rsquo;s try to increase the processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading from Kafka you usually get 1 task per partition, so if you have 6 partitions and 48 cores you are not using 87.5 percent of your cluster. That could be adjusted with the following property &lt;code&gt;**minPartitions&lt;/code&gt;.**&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KSQL, a horror tale</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-22-ksql-a-horror-tale/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-22-ksql-a-horror-tale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After spending several weeks working on a ksql solution to filter billions of events and determine their destination topic, I was disappointed to find that it did not live up to my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped for a more robust product that would align with our needs. Previously, we utilized a similar filter in Spark, incurring traffic costs for both Confluent and AWS. With kSQL, the advantage was that we could avoid paying for AWS traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Repairing metadata unity catalog</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-02-repairing-metadata-unity-catalog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 13:25:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-10-02-repairing-metadata-unity-catalog/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been subscribed to &lt;a href="https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/data-engineering-weekly-148"&gt;https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/data-engineering-weekly-148&lt;/a&gt; for years. This last number included several on-call posts on Medium. I found these quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I got an alert from Metaplane that a cost monitor dashboard was out of date. I checked the processes, and everything was fine. I ran a query to check the freshness of the data and it was ok too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaplane checks our delta table freshness by querying the table information available in the Unity Catalog. For some unknown reason that metadata didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any update. I ran an optimization operation (the table tiny) and the metadata didn&amp;rsquo;t update either.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Adding extra params on DatabricksRunNowOperator</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-07-28-extra_params_databricksrunnow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 16:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-07-28-extra_params_databricksrunnow/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/runnow"&gt;new Databricks jobs API 2.1&lt;/a&gt; you have different parameters depending on the kind of tasks you have in your workflow. Like: jar_params, sql_params, python_params, notebook_params&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not always the airflow operator is ready to handle all of the. If we check the &lt;a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-databricks/stable/operators/run_now.html"&gt;current release of the DatabricksRunNowOperator&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that there is only support for:
notebook_params
python_params
python_named_parameters
jar_params
spark_submit_params
And not the query_params mentioned earlier. But there is a way of combining both, there is a param called &lt;em&gt;jsob&lt;/em&gt; that allows you to write the payload of a databricksrunnow and it will also merge the content of the JSON with your named_params!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enabling Unity Catalog</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-05-23-enabling-unity-catalog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 07:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-05-23-enabling-unity-catalog/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks setting up the unity catalog for my company. It&amp;rsquo;s been an extremely tiring process. And there are several concepts to bring here. My main point is to have a clear view of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: as of today with &lt;a href="https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks"&gt;https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks&lt;/a&gt; release 1.17.0, some steps should be done in an &amp;ldquo;awkward way&amp;rdquo; that is, the account API does not expose the catalog&amp;rsquo;s endpoint and should be done through a workspace.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Duplicates with delta, how can it be?</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-03-20-delta-duplicates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:50:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2023-03-20-delta-duplicates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Long time without writing!
On highlights: I left my job at &lt;strong&gt;Schwarz It&lt;/strong&gt; in December last year, and now I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time employee at Wallbox! I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with my new job, and I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced interesting stuff. This one was just one of these strange cases where you start doubting the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="context"&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my main tables represents sensor measures from our chargers with millisecond precision. The numbers are quite high, we are talking over 2 billion rows per day. So the analytic model doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle that level of granularity.
The analyst created a table that will make a window of 5 minutes, select some specific sensors and write there those values as a column. To keep the data consistent they were generating fake rows between sessions, so if a value was missing a synthetic value would be put in place.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Testing Databricks Photon</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-08-12-testing-photon-engine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 09:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-08-12-testing-photon-engine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was a bit skeptical about photon since I realized that it cost about double the amount of DBU, required specifically optimized machines and did not support UDFs (it was my main target).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Databricks Official Docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="limitations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not support Spark Structured Streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not support UDFs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not support RDD APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not expected to improve short-running queries (&amp;lt;2 seconds), for example, queries against small amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Most of the changes were as dramatic as moving tables from ORC to delta revamping the partition strategy to some as simple as upgrading the runtime version to 10.4 so the ETL starts using low-shuffle merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at my job, we have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of jobs. Each ETL can be easily launched at *30 with different parameters so I wanted to dig into the most effective strategy for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pusing data to tinybird for free</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-07-25-pushing-data-to-tinybird-free/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-07-25-pushing-data-to-tinybird-free/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So my azure subscription expired and I ended up losing the function I was using to feed my real-time data on analytics (part of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/adrianabreu/titsa-gtfs-api"&gt;Transportes Insulares de Tenerife SA&lt;/a&gt; analysis I was making).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after some struggle, I decided to move it to a GitHub action. Why? Because the free mins per month were more than enough and because I just needed some script to run on a cron and that script just makes a quest and a post. So, it was quite straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reading firebase data</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-07-01-reading-firebase-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 07:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-07-01-reading-firebase-data/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Firebase is a common component nowadays for most mobile apps. And it can provide some useful insights, for example in my previous company we use it to detect where the people left at the initial app wizard. (We could measure it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple to export your data to BigQuery: &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/bigquery-export"&gt;https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/bigquery-export&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe your lake is in AWS or Azure. In the next lines, I will try to explain how to load the data in your lake and some improvements we have applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Qbeast</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-06-30-qbeast/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-06-30-qbeast/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I ran into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qbeast_io"&gt;Qbeast&lt;/a&gt; which is an open-source project on top of delta lake I needed to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introductory post explains it quite well: &lt;a href="https://qbeast.io/qbeast-format-enhanced-data-lakehouse/"&gt;https://qbeast.io/qbeast-format-enhanced-data-lakehouse/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is quite good and it seems helpful if you need to write your custom data source as everything is documented. And well as I&amp;rsquo;m in love with note-taking I want to dig into the following three topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining how the format works (including optimizations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describing how the sampling push is implementing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the table tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1-qbeast-format"&gt;1. Qbeast format&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be better explained with diagrams. Remember delta lake? We had a _delta_log folder with files pointing to files. Now Qbeast has extended this delta_log and has added some new properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Faker with PySpark</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-05-31-faker-pyspark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 09:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-05-31-faker-pyspark/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m preparing a small blog post about some tweakings I’ve done for a delta table, but I want to dig into the Spark UI differences before this. As this was done as part of my work I’m reproducing the problem with some generated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know about &lt;a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/"&gt;Faker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;boy&lt;/em&gt; it is really simple and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I want to generate a small dataset for a dimension product table including its id, category and price.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Git 101</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-03-21-git-intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 22:28:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2022-03-21-git-intro/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get to the same place, telling some people about git, what it solves and some basic usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve done it a lot recenly I wanted to write down a post and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esto, nos lleva a varios tests que replican un estado de la tabla y realizan las actualizaciones pertinentes para comprobar todos los flujos y por ende un sobrecoste de ejecución de ese tipo de tests que acaba siendo agotador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una de las soluciones planteadas fue incluir en las builds un parámetro para saltarse el step de ejecución de los tests. Lo cual es legítimo pero al menos para mí, resulta algo arbitrario. Buscando otro concens llegamos a: en las pull request se ejecutarán todos los tests y en el resto de builds (manuales o automáticas de rama) se excluirán estos tests, para que al hacer pruebas o durante las integraciones de las ramas no estemos acumulando tiempo en tests ya validados.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Multiplying rows in Spark</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2021-11-11-multiplying-rows-in-spark/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:32:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2021-11-11-multiplying-rows-in-spark/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I checked on a Pull Request that bothered me since I saw it from the first time.

&lt;p&gt;And we have an advertising campaign definition like this:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;FakeBank001&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s put into situation, there was a connection update between devops and bitbucket and suddenly most of our pipelines stopped working. They told me to change the connection in the yaml file and that didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I participated in some small code problems and practised some regex. I got used to it and feel quite good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today I had to use it again. I had the following dataframe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;product&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;attributes&lt;/th&gt;

Este proyecto está bastante avanzado y hace un uso intensivo de los plugins de sbt. De hecho, una tarea que tengo próximamente es hacer una plantilla para proyectos. Así que quería repasar los conceptos básicos de sbt en una serie de posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¿Qué es sbt &lt;strong&gt;scala build tool&lt;/strong&gt;? Es una herramienta para gestionar proyectos en scala. Es la más utilizada (casi el 95% de los proyectos se hacen en sbt) y uno de sus puntos fuertes es que permite trabajar con múltiples versiones de scala haciendo cross-compilation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A funny bug</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2021-07-21-funny-bug/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2021-07-21-funny-bug/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ayer mismo estaba intentando analizar unos data_types para completar una exportación al backend. La idea era sencilla, buscar para cada usuario la ultima información disponible en una tabla que representaba actualizaciones sobre su perfil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Como a su perfil podías &amp;ldquo;añadir&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;actualizar&amp;rdquo; y &amp;ldquo;eliminar&amp;rdquo; cosas, pues existian los tres tipos en la tabla. Para que la imaginemos mejor sería tal que así:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;user_id&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;favorite_stuff&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;operation&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;metadata&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Chocolate&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Add&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Chocolate&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Update&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Remove&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De tal manera que habría que combinar todos los eventos para saber cual es el perfil actual del usuario y aplicar cierta lógica.

Ahora estoy trabajando con aws + github + python. Y bueno, al margen de los cambios de conceptos y demás, me ha llevado bastante encontrar un flujo de trabajo que no me pareciera &amp;ldquo;frágil&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo primero y que me ha decepcionado bastante es que github no incluye soporte para hostear paquetes de python.

&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, tras estabilizar un proyecto y consolidar su nueva etapa, necesitabamos simplificar la solución implementada para migrar datos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una representación sencilla de la arquitectura actual sería:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://adrianabreu.com/images/data-factory/original-architecture.png" alt="Arquitectura actual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En un flujo muy sencillo sería esto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La etl escribe un fichero csv con spark en un directorio de un blob storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La primera function filtra los ficheros de spark que no son part- y se encarga de notificar a una function que actua de gateway para el batch con que fichero queremos enviar, el nombre original, el path y el nombre que queremos darle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esta function de gateway se encarga de realizar las llamadas necesarias a la api de Azure para generar una tarea en el batch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El batch se encarga de comprimir el fichero y enviarlo al sftp del cliente, recuperando las credenciales según el tipo de fichero que se trate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este proceso nos permitía trabajar con dos versiones del proyecto en lo que hacíamos la migración a la nueva versión. Ahora que la nueva versión ya está consolidada y hemos conseguido además que el cliente utilice un formato de compresión que podemos escribir directamente desde spark sin recurrir al batch, es el momento de cambiar la arquitectura de transferencia de datos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tipos de join en spark</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-12-29-spark-joins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 18:52:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2020-12-29-spark-joins/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hace unos días tuve la fortuna (o desgracia) de implementar la lógica más compleja de todo el dominio.
El resultado, como esperaba, una etl que falaba por recursos constantementes. El problema:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Caused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Could not execute broadcast in 300 secs. You can increase the timeout for broadcasts via spark.sql.broadcastTimeout or disable broadcast join by setting spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to -1

Otro motivo es alinearse con el negocio donde los cierres pueden producirse en días concretos, por ejemplo, un domingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En esos casos si tenemos los datos particionados por días nos interesa saber a que domingo correspondería cada uno de los datos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los que venimos de otros entornos tendemos a pensar en esas complicadas librerías de fechas (moment.js, jodatime, etc).

¿Qué es una template? Es un pedazo de html envuelto entre entre etiquetas ng-template tal que así:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;ng-template&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#e6db74"&gt;”as-template”&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; I won’t be rendered
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;ng-template&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si esto lo ponemos en un componente, tal como en el siguiente ejemplo en el navegador aparecerá: NADA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¿Por qué?&lt;/strong&gt; Porque las plantillas de angular no se renderizan al ser evaluadas.

Era la única forma sensata que tenía de poder gestionar la UI cuando entrara la máquina VLIW sin que todo fuera un caos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para ello he recurrido a mi aplicación favorita: Chuck Norris client app. (Ya la he hecho en AngularJS y Angular previamente). Como boilerplate he utilizado el template de visual studio, ya que quería tener compatibilidad con typescript.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Un breve sumario</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-10-08-breve-sumario/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 18:28:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-10-08-breve-sumario/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;El mes de septiembre ha sido un poco caótico, pero ya creo que me he adaptado a la rutina. Por lo pronto he empezado con el blog, ahora el auto despliegue va mucho mejor, estoy utilizando CircleCI en vez de Wecker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por otra parte, el diseño del blog se ha separado por mucho del tema original, y no contento con esto he mejorado el desarrollo del tema permitiendo el uso de Sass.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Angular series I - Proyección de contenido (Content projection)</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-08-14-angular-series-i-transclusion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:32:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-08-14-angular-series-i-transclusion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cuando creé este blog tenía bastante claro que uno de los objetivos principales era que me sirviera de utilidad para interiorizar lo que voy aprendiendo.
Y aunque he escrito ciertas cosas útiles para mi día a día no estoy registrando ni una centésima parte de la información que mi mente ha ido procesando estos
meses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Así que voy a dedicarme a escribir un artículo semanal sobre un tema con el que llevo ya casi un año: &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Auto deployment en gh-pages con Travis</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-08-04-autodeploy-con-travis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 16:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-08-04-autodeploy-con-travis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Una de las mejores características de github sin duda alguna, son las &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;gh-pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las gh-pages nos permiten desplegar el código de nuestra aplicación frontend a través de esta rama, de tal forma que muchos de nuestros proyectos (por ejemplo este blog) estén disponibles sin tener limitaciones de hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pero sin duda una desventaja es el hecho de tener que mantener el deploy de nuestras revisiones: cambiar de rama, eliminar el contenido, hacer una build y desplegar.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mi experiencia con React</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-07-28-mi-experiencia-con-react/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2017 17:11:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-07-28-mi-experiencia-con-react/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hoy se cumple un mes desde que entregué mi trabajo de fin de grado. &lt;em&gt;(Modestia aparte, conseguí un 10)&lt;/em&gt;. Han pasado muchas cosas desde entonces, como que por ejemplo ahora mismo estoy viviendo en Barcelona y que trabajo para nada más y nada menos que &lt;strong&gt;Plain Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;. Pero al margen de eso, vamos a centrarnos en mi trabajo de fin de grado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En tercero de grado de ingeniería informática es posible escoger una especialidad. Yo descontento con la mayoría me decidí por Ingeniería de Computadores &lt;em&gt;a.k.a.&lt;/em&gt; Hardware. Y a lo largo de estos dos cursos me encontré con dos asignaturas de &lt;strong&gt;Arquitectura de Computadores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Empezar a programar</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-06-04-empezar-a-programar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2017 13:07:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-06-04-empezar-a-programar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Creo que me he visto en más de una decena de ocasiones aconsejando a gente como empezar en el mundo
de la programación, así que esta entrada viene dedicada a todos ellos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por supuesto se trata de una guía basada en mi opinión y solo mi opinión.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="daw-o-dam"&gt;¿DAW o DAM?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realmente mi respuesta es bastante clara: &lt;strong&gt;DAW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El mundo web cada vez va tomando más y más fuerza.
Ya se pueden desarrollar aplicaciones de escritorio utilizando como base aplicaciones web con tecnologías
como &lt;a href="https://electron.atom.io/"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt; (un buen ejemplo de este tipo de aplicaciones &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;). Y además también
se pueden desarrollar aplicaciones móviles con &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt; e &lt;a href="https://ionicframework.com/"&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docker</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-04-09-docker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 15:20:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-04-09-docker/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="qué-es-docker"&gt;¿Qué es docker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker es un software que permite automatizar el despliegue de aplicaciones utilizando contenedores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los contenedores hacen uso de la virtualización a nivel de sistema operativo, con lo cual son mucho más ligeros y rápidos que las máquinas virtuales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="para-qué-lo-puedo-necesitar"&gt;¿Para qué lo puedo necesitar?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el día a día, una de las cosas para las que Docker me resulta más útil sin duda es para desplegar las bases de datos en desarrollo.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Capas en el backend</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-04-08-capas-en-el-backend/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 17:33:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-04-08-capas-en-el-backend/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Una de las cosas más difíciles cuando ves un proyecto de backend por primera vez es discernir la funcionalidad y responsabilidad de las distintas capas. Así que me he planteado dar una visión general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antes de nada, quiero aclarar que es probable que esta nomenclatura no coincida con otra que veais por ahí, existen muchos sinónimos para los mismos conceptos, yo por mi parte, voy a explicar cual utilizo actualmente.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Interacción a través de ViewChild en Angular</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-24-interaccion-a-traves-de-viewchild/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2017 23:11:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-24-interaccion-a-traves-de-viewchild/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hoy me he encontrado con una situación peculiar en un código. Aunque considero que quizás como está realizada la tarea no sea la mejor opción, creo que es un buen ejemplo para entender algunos conceptos de Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partiendo de una aplicaicón muy básica donde tenemos dos componentes: &lt;strong&gt;AppComponent&lt;/strong&gt; y &lt;strong&gt;ChildComponent&lt;/strong&gt;, vamos a renderizar dinámicamente el componente hijo desde el componente padre y ejecutar una serie de acciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empecemos por el componente padre:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Como construir un portfolio</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-12-como-construir-un-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 10:39:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-12-como-construir-un-portfolio/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Desde hace un tiempo en los países anglosajones los desarrolladores tienen una herramienta más importante que su CV, el portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un portfolio no es más que una muestra de tus trabajos y una justificación de las habilidades escritas en tu CV. A día de hoy, es increíblemente fácil tener un portfolio. Pero ya que voy a hablar de eso, aprovecharé para hablar también de qué debería contener un portfolio, y como enfocar el portfolio de un desarrollador junior proporcionando algunas ideas básicas.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sin componentes a componentes</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-11-sin-componentes-a-componentes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2017 17:44:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-11-sin-componentes-a-componentes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hace unos meses mientras me formaba en Angular 1 hice con un amigo un cliente para una api que proporcionaba frases de Chuck Norris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fue un desarrollo divertido donde almacenábamos las frases descargadas en localStorage y permítiamos filtrar las frases por categorías.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El diseño era modular y me quedé contento con lo que aprendí. Pero entonces entré en prácticas en la empresa y me puse a formarme en Angular 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quizás deberías empezar un blog</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-04-quizas-deberias-empezara-un-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 19:46:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-03-04-quizas-deberias-empezara-un-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Me encanta leer artículos de programación y de tecnología. Leo muchísimos artículos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es más, considero que paso al menos de media, 2 horas diarias leyendo esta clase de artículos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pero soy otro lector invisible más, no devuelvo lo que aprendo a la comunidad (aunque ahora me he ido animando con los comentarios) y lo peor, no lo almaceno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Un blog puede ser una parte más de tu portfolio, puede recoger tus dudas y tu avance. Recuerdo, leer muchos artículos del blog de &lt;a href="https://giltesa.com/"&gt;giltesa&lt;/a&gt;, aunque en aquellos momentos yo estaba programando en pañales, me gustaba mucho ver los pequeños códigos en C que ponía.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Probando Hugo</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-02-05-probando-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:31:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-02-05-probando-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;La verdad es que estoy asombrado. Hexo me tenía muy contento, pero aún así el rendimiento no me convencía tanto como esperaba. Y me pasaba los días dando largas hasta ponerme a postear. Aprovechando que quería hacer una pequeña limpieza antes de ponerme con el trabajo de fin de grado, he estado mirando este generador, Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este generador basado en el lenguaje Go, es increíblemente potente, portable, y sencillo de instalar. Sinceramente, tras probar Jekyll, Hexo y Hugo, sin duda me quedo con este último. Habia visto otros como Octopress, pero tampoco llegó a convencerme.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nuevos comienzos</title><link>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-01-08-nuevos-comienzos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 10:22:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adrianabreu.com/blog/2017-01-08-nuevos-comienzos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;No creía que fuera a estar escribiendo esto tan pronto, pero hace poco terminé de realizar las prácticas externas y ya tengo un trabajo en esa misma empresa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mis labores, al igual que en las prácticas, consiste en desarrollar utilizando Angular 2 y Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ido aprendiendo (y sigo, y seguiré) muchísimo. Y es por eso que necesito este blog. Un lugar donde compartir toda la información que voy absorbiendo sobre esta tecnología que cada día me gusta más.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
