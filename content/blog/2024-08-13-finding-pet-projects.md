As my company undergoes layoffs, I'm back on the job hunt. While I'm in the field of data, I often find myself missing the hands-on experience that comes from personal projects. I realized that I'm not practicing all the skills I need.

During a recent interview, I was asked about my experience with sending reports via email—something I hadn’t done in a few years. That got me thinking: could I turn this into a pet project?

Within a day, I decided to create a script that emails my Lichess statistics using Python libraries like [Berserk](https://berserk.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).

I also wanted to experiment with [Pydantic settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/), as I plan to incorporate them into upcoming projects with [Databricks Asset Bundles](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/index.html).

In just a few hours, I developed a solid project skeleton that I'm excited to iterate on further. You can check it out here: [Lichess Mail Reporter](https://github.com/adrianabreu/lichess-mail-reporter).
