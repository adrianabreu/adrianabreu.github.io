Yesterday I took (and passed with more than 90% yay!) the [Associate Spark Developer Certificaton](https://databricks.com/learn/certification/apache-spark-developer-associate). And before I forget I want to share my experience:

In general:
- First of all, I needed to install Windows as there was no Linux support for the control software used during the exam.
- Secondly, you need to disable both the antivirus and the firewall before joining. I didn't disable the antivirus and the technician contacted me as there was a problem with the webcam despite I was able to see myself.
- It is a controlled window started by the software, not a browser page (I had a good zoom on the example docs they provide, and well not the same on the software window).
- You can mark the questions for reviewing them later.

About the exam:

1. The practice exam is a really good practice field, I saw at least 6 questions that I had practiced before.
2. In earlier posts I dug into the architecture and execution part. If you have a solid background the questions are really easy. 
3. The provided API is a pdf. You better practice with the one given before or you may have a bad time looking for the functions and the column functions.
4. Most questions should be read carefully as they are quite simple and the correct answer may depend on a single word in the question.

If you are used to working with the spark API you should be able to pass it too. Here is a list of the post I've published (I know that there are some typos I found myself while practicing but god knows I deserve some rest!)

1. [Spark Architecture](/spark-certification/2022-06-07-spark-architecture)
2. [Spark Execution](/spark-certification/2022-06-08-spark-execution)
3. [Spark Structured Api](/spark-certification/2022-06-10-spark-structured-api)
4. [Spark Data Sources](/spark-certification/2022-06-11-spark-data-sources)
5. [Spark Udf-Udaf](/spark-certification/2022-06-19-udf-udaf) 
6. [Spark Dates](/spark-certification/2022-06-29-spark-dates) 

And if you want to take the practice exam interactively [here it is](/spark-certification/2022-06-28-databricks-practice-exam)

I would like to add two entries, one for the Garbage Collector and one for the Structured Streaming, but those were mainly not needed for the certification :)
